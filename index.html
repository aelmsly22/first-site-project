        <p>. . . be whoever you want to be and do whatever you want to do. What would it be? A pilot? A doctor? For me, I never knew the answer. I never found something that fit me well. I’ve tried many paths, and nothing was quite right. Then, one day, I tried coding. Suddenly, I had found this challenging, engaging, and incredible activity I loved. <br> My world changed. I could make anything, change anything, be anything. I could work in any industry I had passion for, and I could learn something new every day. I didn’t know how to much, and I still am learning a lot, but I saw potential. I saw how I could pour my heart into programming and continue to excited about it every single day. I had found my passion. <br> This website is representative of my growth. I’m still learning, and this is the first full website I’ve ever made. I want this to serve as a measurement for myself, but also as a tool for anyone who finds it. Programming is a path full of potential, and I encourage you to check out “Resources” to get started.</p>
